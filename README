feeds with html. Feed urls are encapsulated with {{http://feed.rss}} and may 
optionally specifiy a function to use in generating the HTML (eg: 
{{http://feed.rss|simple}}).

Currently the available display functions are:
 * simple - (returns just the content of an entry in the feed)

 - More to come

Things you might need to run this:
* Python
* A Computer
* python-feedparser - http://www.feedparser.org
