The purpose of this program is to take a template file and replace any rss     #
feeds with html. Feed urls are encapsulated with {{http://feed.rss}} and may 
optionally specifiy a function to use in generating the HTML (eg: 
{{http://feed/atom|simple}}) and also a number to specify how many entries 
to display (eg: {{http://feeds/rss|link|20}}).

Currently the available display functions are:
 * simple - (returns just the content of an entry in the feed)
 * link - display the title and a url to the post
 * delicious - display the link and the summary
 * identica - display the time and text of post
 * vimeo - display the actual video 

All the above displays will echo out a leading <li> tag. If you want to
add your own custom display, just add it in the ankh_displays.py file and
be sure to add it to the display_functions list.

Things you might need to run this:
* Python
* A Computer
* python-feedparser - http://www.feedparser.org

Suggested use: python ankh.py -t ankh.template -o ankh.html

Also works great in a cron :)
